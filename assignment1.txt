1. Discuss your initial thoughts in details on how you will design this application?
We will design the fuel quote form along with the the client's profile information portion of this project through O.O.D. We will also develop a front-end and back-end server for our website to handle requests and responses between the client and server. The web portion of the project will follow a MVC (Models-Views-Controllers) format, the form quote and client profile information will be modular, and the client's fuel quote history will be working with a database.

2. Discuss what development methodology you will use and why?
We plan on using SCRUM as the project's development methodology since it allows for agile software development and developing in "sprints" based on a "backlog" of requirements will allow us to effciently accomplish our overall long-term task while being able to quickly report the state of the software to each other. 

3. Provide high level design / architecture of your solution that you are proposing?

Functional requirements: Login and registration, profile management, generation of fuel quote form with detailed factors listed, history of fuel quotes provided per client, data storage
Non-functional requirements:
Maintainability - multiple people will be working on the software and it's important that the code is readable and follows best practices
Security - sensitive financial information of the clients will be recorded on their accounts
Reliability/consistency
Scalability - if the application is successful, there could be a large number of clients
Usability is also a consideration.
